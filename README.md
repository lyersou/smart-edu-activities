Intelligent Recommendation System for Educational Activities Based on Adaptive Learning
This work presents the creation and development of an Intelligent Recommendation System (IRS) for learning activities designed to support English language study for children aged 3 to 12 years. Implemented as an Android mobile application, the system is based on adaptive learning to provide personalized content according to a profile questionnaire, usage history, test results, and the behavior of similar learners. The outcome is a functional application capable of dynamically suggesting appropriate learning activities that support and enhance childrenâ€™s engagement and progress.
